ILIOPUBIC EMINENCE


Medial to the anterior inferior iliac spine is a broad, shallow groove, over which the iliacus and psoas major muscles pass. 

This groove is bounded medially by an eminence, the iliopubic eminence (or iliopectineal eminence), which marks the point of union of the ilium and pubis.

It constitutes a lateral border of the pelvic inlet.

The iliopectineal line is the border of the eminence.

The psoas minor, when present, inserts at the pectineal line of the eminence.
