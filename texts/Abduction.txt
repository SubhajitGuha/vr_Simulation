ABDUCTION


Abduction is a motion that pulls a structure or part away from the midline of the body, carried out by one or more abductor muscles. 

In the case of fingers and toes, it is spreading the digits apart, away from the centerline of the hand or foot.

For example, raising the arms up, such as when tightrope-walking, is an example of abduction at the shoulder.

When the legs are splayed at the hip, such as when doing a star jump or doing a split, the legs are abducted at the hip.
