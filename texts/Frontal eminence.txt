FRONTAL EMINENCE

A frontal eminence (or tuber frontale) refers to one of two rounded elevations on the frontal bone that lie about three centimeters above the supraorbital margin on each side of the frontal suture.

Eminences vary in size in different individuals, are occasionally asymmetrical, and are especially prominent in young skulls. 

The surface of the bone above them is smooth, and covered by the galea aponeurotica.
