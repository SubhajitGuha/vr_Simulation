PECTORAL GIRDLE


The shoulder girdle, or pectoral girdle, is the anatomical mechanism that allows for all upper arm and shoulder movement in humans. 

The shoulder girdle consists of five muscles that attach to the clavicle and scapula and allow for the motion of the sternoclavicular joint (connection between sternum and clavicle) and acromioclavicular joint (connection between clavicle and scapula). 

The five muscles that comprise the function of the shoulder girdle are:
    -the trapezius muscle (upper, middle, and lower), 
    -levator scapulae muscle, 
    -rhomboid muscles (major and minor), 
    -serratus anterior muscle, 
    -and pectoralis minor muscle.
