ANTERIOR COMPARTMENT OF LEG


The anterior compartment of the leg is a fascial compartment of the lower limb. 

It contains muscles that produce dorsiflexion and participate in inversion and eversion of the foot, as well as vascular and nervous elements including the anterior tibial artery and veins, and the deep fibular nerve.


== Muscles ==

The muscles of the compartment are:

-tibialis anterior
-extensor hallucis longus
-extensor digitorum longus
-fibularis tertius (peroneus tertius)


== Function ==

The compartment contains muscles that are dorsiflexors and participate in inversion and eversion of the foot.


== Innervation and blood supply ==

The anterior compartment of the leg is supplied by the deep fibular nerve (deep peroneal nerve), a branch of the common fibular nerve. 

The nerve contains axons from the L4, L5, and S1 spinal nerves.
Blood for the compartment is supplied by the anterior tibial artery, which runs between the tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus muscles. 

When the artery crosses the extensor retinaculum, it changes its name to dorsalis pedis artery.
