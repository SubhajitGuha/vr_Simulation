GROOVE FOR MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY


The internal surface of the parietal bone is concave; it presents depressions corresponding to the cerebral convolutions, and numerous furrows (grooves) for the ramifications of the middle meningeal artery; the latter run upward and backward from the sphenoidal angle, and from the central and posterior part of the squamous border.
