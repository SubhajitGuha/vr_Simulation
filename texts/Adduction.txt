ADDUCTION


Adduction is a motion that pulls a structure or part towards the midline of the body, or towards the midline of a limb, carried out by one or more adductor muscles. 

In the case of fingers and toes, it is bringing the digits together, towards the centerline of the hand or foot. 

Dropping the arms to the sides, and bringing the knees together, are examples of adduction.

Adduction of the wrist is also known as ulnar deviation which moves the hand towards the ulnar styloid (or, towards the little finger).

Abduction of the wrist is also called radial deviation which moves the hand moving towards the radial styloid (or, towards the thumb).
