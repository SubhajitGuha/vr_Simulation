TRAPEZOID LIGAMENT


The trapezoid ligament, the anterior and lateral fasciculus, is broad, thin, and quadrilateral: it is placed obliquely between the coracoid process and the clavicle.

It is attached, below, to the upper surface of the coracoid process; above, to the oblique ridge on the under surface of the clavicle.

Its anterior border is free; its posterior border is joined with the conoid ligament, the two forming, by their junction, an angle projecting backward.
