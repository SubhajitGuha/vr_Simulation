HEAD OF HUMERUS


The head (caput humeri), is nearly hemispherical in form. It is directed upward, medialward, and a little backward, and articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula to form the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint). 

The circumference of its articular surface is slightly constricted and is termed the anatomical neck, in contradistinction to a constriction below the tubercles called the surgical neck which is frequently the seat of fracture.

Fracture of the anatomical neck rarely occurs.

The diameter of the humeral head is generally larger in men than in women.
