PNEUMATIZED BONE

Skeletal pneumaticity is the presence of air spaces within bones. 

It is generally produced during development by excavation of bone by pneumatic diverticula (air sacs) from an air-filled space, such as the lungs or nasal cavity. 

Pneumatization is highly variable between individuals, and bones not normally pneumatized can become pneumatized in pathological development.

In humans, the pneumatised bone are: 
    -the frontal bone
    -the ethmoid bone
    -the sphenoid bone
    -the 2 maxilla
    
Some authors argue about the temporal bone.
