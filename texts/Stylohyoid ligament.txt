STYLOHYOID LIGAMENT


The stylohyoid ligament is a ligament that connects the hyoid bone to the temporal styloid process (of the temporal bone of the skull).


== Structure ==

The stylohyoid ligament connects the lesser horn of hyoid bone to the styloid process of the temporal bone of the skull.


== Clinical significance ==

The stylohyoid ligament frequently contains a little cartilage in its center, which is sometimes partially ossified in Eagle syndrome.


== Other animals ==

In many animals, the epihyal is a distinct bone in the centre of the stylohyoid ligament, which is similar to that seen in Eagle syndrome.
