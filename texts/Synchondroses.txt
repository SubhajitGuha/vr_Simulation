SYNCHONDROSES


A synchondrosis (or primary cartilaginous joint) is a type of cartilaginous joint where hyaline cartilage completely joins together two bones. 

Synchondroses are different than symphyses (secondary cartilaginous joints) which are formed of fibrocartilage. 

Synchondroses are immovable joints and are thus referred to as synarthroses.
