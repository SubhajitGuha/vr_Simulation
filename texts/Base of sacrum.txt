BASE OF SACRUM


The base of the sacrum, which is broad and expanded, is directed upward and forward. 

On either side of the base is a large projection known as an ala of sacrum and these alae (wings) articulate with the sacroiliac joints. 

The alae support the psoas major muscles and the lumbosacral trunk which connects the lumbar plexus with the sacral plexus. 

In the articulated pelvis the alae are continuous with the iliac fossa.
