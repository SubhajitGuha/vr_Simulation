SKELETON OF FREE UPPER LIMB


The free part of the upper limbs are the forelimbs of an upright-postured tetrapod vertebrate, extending from the humerus down to and including the digits, including all the musculatures and ligaments involved with the elbow, wrist and knuckle joints. 

In humans, each upper limb is divided into the arm, forearm and hand, and is primarily used for climbing, lifting and manipulating objects.


=== Musculoskeletal system ===

==== Arm ====

The arm proper (brachium), sometimes called the upper arm, the region between the shoulder and the elbow, is composed of the humerus with the elbow joint at its distal end.


==== Forearm ====

The forearm (Latin: antebrachium), composed of the radius and ulna; the latter is the main distal part of the elbow joint, while the former composes the main proximal part of the wrist joint.


==== Wrist ====

The wrist (Latin: carpus), composed of the carpal bones, articulates at the wrist joint (or radiocarpal joint) proximally and the carpometacarpal joint distally. 

The wrist can be divided into two components separated by the midcarpal joints. 


==== Hand ====

The hand (Latin: manus), the metacarpals (in the hand proper) and the phalanges of the fingers, form the metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP, including the knuckles) and interphalangeal joints (IP).
