INTERNAL THORACIC VEIN


In human anatomy, the internal thoracic vein (previously known as the internal mammary vein) is a vessel that drains the chest wall and breasts.


== Structure ==

Bilaterally, the internal thoracic vein arises from the superior epigastric vein, and accompanies the internal thoracic artery along its course. 

It runs just lateral to the sternum. 

It drains the intercostal veins, although the posterior drainage is often handled by the azygous veins. 

It terminates in the brachiocephalic vein. 

It has a width of 2-3 mm.


=== Variations ===

Bifurcation of each internal thoracic vein is common. 

The left internal thoracic vein may bifurcate between ribs 3-4 or remain as a single vein. 

The right internal thoracic vein may bifurcate between ribs 2-4 or remain as a single vein.


== Function ==

The internal thoracic vein drains the chest wall and the breasts.


== Clinical significance ==

The internal thoracic vein can act as a collateral circulation for blood from the inferior vena cava to the superior vena cava. 

This can work in either direction. 

It may partially compensate for disturbances to blood flow.
