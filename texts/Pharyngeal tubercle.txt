PHARYNGEAL TUBERCLE

The pharyngeal tubercle is a part of the occipital bone of the head and neck. 

It is located on the lower surface of the basilar part of occipital bone, about 1 cm. anterior to the foramen magnum. 

The pharyngeal tubercle gives attachment to the fibrous raphe of the pharynx, also known as the pharyngeal raphe.

This is the point of attachment for the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle.
