RADIAL TUBEROSITY


Beneath the neck of the radius, on the medial side, is an eminence, the radial tuberosity; its surface is divided into:

-a posterior, rough portion, for the insertion of the tendon of the biceps brachii.

-an anterior, smooth portion, on which a bursa is interposed between the tendon and the bone.

Ligaments that support the elbow joint also attach to the radial tuberosity.
