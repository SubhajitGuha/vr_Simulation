ANTEROMEDIAL SURFACE OF FIBULA


The anterior surface is the interval between the antero-lateral and antero-medial borders. 

It is extremely narrow and flat in the upper third of its extent; broader and grooved longitudinally in its lower third; it serves for the origin of three muscles: the extensor digitorum longus, extensor hallucis longus, and peroneus tertius.
