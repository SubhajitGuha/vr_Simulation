CYLINDRICAL JOINT


A cylindrical joint is a two-degrees-of-freedom kinematic pair used in mechanisms. 

Cylindrical joints provide single-axis sliding function as well as a single axis rotation, providing a way for two rigid bodies to translate and rotate freely. 

This can be pictured by an unsecured axle mounted on a chassis, as it may freely rotate and translate. 

An example of this would be the rotating rods of a Table football.
