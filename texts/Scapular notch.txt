SCAPULAR NOTCH

At the lateral part of the superior border of the scapula is a deep, semicircular notch, the scapular notch, formed partly by the base of the coracoid process. 

This notch is converted into a foramen by the superior transverse scapular ligament, and serves for the passage of the suprascapular nerve; sometimes the ligament is ossified.
