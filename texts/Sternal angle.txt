STERNAL ANGLE


The sternal angle is located at the point where the body joins the manubrium.

The sternal angle can be felt at the point where the sternum projects farthest forward.

However, in some people the sternal angle is concave or rounded.

During physical examinations, the sternal angle is a useful landmark because the second rib attaches here.
