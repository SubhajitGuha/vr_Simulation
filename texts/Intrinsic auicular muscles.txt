INTRINSIC AURICULAR MUSCLES


The intrinsic muscles of the external ear are:

    -The helicis major is a narrow vertical band situated upon the anterior margin of the helix. It arises below, from the spina helicis, and is inserted into the anterior border of the helix, just where it is about to curve backward.
    
    -The helicis minor is an oblique fasciculus, covering the crus helicis.
    
    -The tragicus is a short, flattened vertical band on the lateral surface of the tragus. Also known as the mini lobe.
    
    -The antitragicus arises from the outer part of the antitragus, and is inserted into the cauda helicis and antihelix.
    
    -The transverse muscle is placed on the cranial surface of the pinna. It consists of scattered fibers, partly tendinous and partly muscular, extending from the eminentia conchae to the prominence corresponding with the scapha.
    
    -The oblique muscle also on the cranial surface, consists of a few fibers extending from the upper and back part of the concha to the convexity immediately above it.
