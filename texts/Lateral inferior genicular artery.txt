LATERAL INFERIOR GENICULAR ARTERY


The lateral inferior genicular is an artery of the leg.


== Course ==

It runs lateralward above the head of the fibula to the front of the knee-joint, passing in its course beneath the lateral head of the gastrocnemius, the fibular collateral ligament, and the tendon of the biceps femoris.


== Branching ==

It ends by dividing into branches, which anastomose with the Inferior medial genicular and superior lateral genicular arteries, and with the anterior recurrent tibial artery.
