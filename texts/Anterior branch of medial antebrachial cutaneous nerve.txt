ANTERIOR BRANCH OF MEDIAL ANTEBRACHIAL CUTANEOUS NERVE/
VOLAR BRANCH

The volar branch (ramus volaris; anterior branch), the larger, passes usually in front of, but occasionally behind, the vena mediana cubiti (median basilic vein).

It then descends on the front of the ulnar side of the forearm, distributing filaments to the skin as far as the wrist, and communicating with the palmar cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve.
