This setup -in which the 'Orthographic scale' is driven by the 'Take a picture' object's size, and is parented to it; is meant to facilitate the rendering of images.

(The usual rendering mode can be recreated adding a new camera, setting it to active camera (Select it and press 'Ctrl+0').

In the customized'Anatomy Shortcuts', pressing 'F12' creates a 'Viewport Render' instead of the traditional 'Render'because it is faster and only shows what you see in the viewport.

If you want to use the compositing (post-rendering effects):
-Press 'N' to open the menu
-Go to 'Visibility' and Press 'Sync Visibility'
This step will make sure that what you see is what you get.
-Render > RenderImage/Animation
