FRONTAL BONE


The frontal bone is a bone in the human skull. The bone consists of two portions. 

These are the vertically oriented squamous part, and the horizontally oriented orbital part, making up the bony part of the forehead, part of the bony orbital cavity holding the eye, and part of the bony part of the nose respectively. 

The name comes from the Latin word frons (meaning "forehead").
