MASTOID ANGLE OF PARIETAL BONE


The mastoid angle is truncated; it articulates with the occipital bone and with the mastoid portion of the temporal, and presents on its inner surface a broad, shallow groove which lodges part of the transverse sinus. 

The point of meeting of this angle with the occipital and the mastoid part of the temporal is named the asterion.
