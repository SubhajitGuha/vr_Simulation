POSTERIOR FONTANELLE

The posterior fontanelle (lambdoid fontanelle, occipital fontanelle) is a gap between bones in the human skull (known as fontanelle), triangular in form and situated at the junction of the sagittal suture and lambdoidal suture. 

It generally closes in 6â€“8 weeks from birth. 

The cranial point in adults corresponding the fontanelle is called 'lambda'. 

A delay in closure is associated with congenital hypothyroidism.
