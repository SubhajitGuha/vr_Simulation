ANTERIOR CLINOID PROCESS


In the sphenoid bone, the posterior border, smooth and rounded, is received into the lateral fissure of the brain; the medial end of this border forms the anterior clinoid process, which gives attachment to the tentorium cerebelli; it is sometimes joined to the middle clinoid process by a spicule of bone, and when this occurs the termination of the groove for the internal carotid artery is converted into a foramen (carotico-clinoid).


== Etymology ==

The anterior and posterior clinoid processes surround the sella turcica like the four corners of a four poster bed. Cline is Greek for bed. â€“oid, as usual, indicates a similarity to. The term may also come from the Greek root klinein or the Latin clinare, both meaning "sloped" as in "inclined".


== Petroclinoid ligament ==

The petroclinoid ligament is a fold of dura mater. It extends between the posterior clinoid process and anterior clinoid process and the petrosal part of the temporal bone of the skull. 
See posterior clinoid process page for full information on this ligament.
