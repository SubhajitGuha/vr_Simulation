LUNATE SURFACE

At the lower part of the acetabulum is the acetabular notch, which is continuous with a circular depression, the acetabular fossa, at the bottom of the cavity of the acetabulum. 

The rest of the acetabulum is formed by a curved, crescent-moon shaped surface, the LUNATE SURFACE, where the joint is made with the head of the femur.
