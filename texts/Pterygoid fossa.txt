PTERYGOID FOSSA


The pterygoid fossa is an anatomical term for the fossa formed by the divergence of the lateral pterygoid plate and the medial pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone.


== Structure ==

The lateral and medial pteryoid plates (of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone) diverge behind and enclose between them a V-shaped fossa, the pterygoid fossa.  

This fossa faces posteriorly, and contains the medial pterygoid muscle and the tensor veli palatini muscle.
