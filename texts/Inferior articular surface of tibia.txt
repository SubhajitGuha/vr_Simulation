INFERIOR ARTICULAR SURFACE OF TIBIA


The inferior articular surface is quadrilateral, and smooth for articulation with the talus. 

It is concave from before backward, broader in front than behind, and traversed from before backward by a slight elevation, separating two depressions. 

It is continuous with that on the medial malleolus.
