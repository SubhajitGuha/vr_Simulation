POSTERIOR BORDER OF FIBULA


The postero-lateral border is prominent; it begins above at the apex, and ends below in the posterior border of the lateral malleolus. 

It is directed lateralward above, backward in the middle of its course, backward, and a little medialward below, and gives attachment to an aponeurosis which separates the peronaei on the lateral surface from the flexor muscles on the posterior surface.
