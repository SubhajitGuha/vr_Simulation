SUPERIOR BORDER OF SCAPULA


The superior border is the shortest and thinnest; it is concave, and extends from the superior angle to the base of the coracoid process. 

It is referred to as the cranial border in animals.

At its lateral part is a deep, semicircular notch, the scapular notch, formed partly by the base of the coracoid process. 

This notch is converted into a foramen by the superior transverse scapular ligament, and serves for the passage of the suprascapular nerve; sometimes the ligament is ossified.

The adjacent part of the superior border affords attachment to the omohyoideus.
