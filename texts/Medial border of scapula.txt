MEDIAL BORDER OF SCAPULA


The medial border (also called the vertebral border or medial margin) is the longest of the three borders, and extends from the superior angle to the inferior angle. 

In animals it is referred to as the dorsal border.Four muscles attach to the medial border. Serratus anterior has a long attachment on the anterior lip. 

Three muscles insert along the posterior lip: 
    the levator scapulae (uppermost), rhomboid minor (middle), and to the rhomboid major (lower middle).
