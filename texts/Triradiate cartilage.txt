TRIRADIATE CARTILAGE


The triradiate cartilage (in Latin cartilago ypsiloformis) is the 'Y'-shaped epiphyseal plate between the ilium, ischium and pubis to form the acetabulum of the os coxae. 


===Human development===

In children, the triradiate cartilage closes at an approximate bone age of 12 years for girls and 14 years for boys.


===Clinical use===

Evaluating the position of the triradiate cartilage on an AP radiograph of the pelvis with both Perkin's line and Hilgenreiner's line can help establish a diagnosis of developmental dysplasia of the hip.
