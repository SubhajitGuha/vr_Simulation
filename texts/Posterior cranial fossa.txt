POSTERIOR CRANIAL FOSSA

The posterior cranial fossa is part of the cranial cavity, located between the foramen magnum and tentorium cerebelli. 

It contains the brainstem and cerebellum.

This is the most inferior of the fossae. It houses the cerebellum, medulla and pons. 

Anteriorly it extends to the apex of the petrous temporal. Posteriorly it is enclosed by the occipital bone. 

Laterally portions of the squamous temporal and mastoid part of the temporal bone form its walls.
