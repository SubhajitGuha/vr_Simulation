TWELFTH RIB


The phrase floating rib or vertebral rib (Latin: costae fluctuantes) refers to the two lowermost, the eleventh and twelfth rib pairs; so-called because they are attached only to the vertebraeâ€“and not to the sternum or cartilage of the sternum.

These ribs are relatively small and delicate, and include a cartilaginous tip.
