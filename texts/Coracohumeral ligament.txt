CORACOHUMERAL LIGAMENT


The coracohumeral ligament is a broad ligament which strengthens the upper part of the capsule of the shoulder joint.

It arises from the lateral border of the coracoid process, and passes obliquely downwards and laterally to the front of the greater tubercle of the humerus, blending with the tendon of the supraspinatus muscle. 

It also blends with the subscapularis muscle. 

It has two bands, anterior and posterior, that insert into the lesser and greater tubercles of the humerus respectively.

This ligament is intimately united to the capsule by its posterior and lower border, but its anterior and upper border presents a free edge, which overlaps the capsule.
