LUMBAR VEINS


The lumbar veins are veins running along the inside of the posterior abdominal wall. 

They are the lumbar equivalent of the posterior intercostal veins of the thorax.


== Structure ==

The lumbar veins accompany the four lumbar arteries on each side of the body. 

Each lumbar vein lies superior to the adjacent lumbar artery (the same arrangement as in the intercostal neurovascular bundles).

The first and second lumbar veins usually join the ascending lumbar vein rather than the inferior vena cava, which then joins the subcostal vein of the same side to form the azygos vein on the right or hemiazygos vein on the left. 

The third and fourth lumbar veins drain into the inferior vena cava.The lumbar veins drain the anterior spinal veins.


=== Relations ===

All of the lumbar veins lie behind the sympathetic trunk on each side. 

On the left, the third and fourth lumbar veins pass behind the abdominal aorta to reach the inferior vena cava. 

On the right, the third and fourth lumbar veins travel a shorter distance.


=== Variation ===

There is variation in which lumbar veins drain to the inferior vena cava and which drain to the ascending lumbar vein, the azygos vein, and the hemiazygos vein. 

A left lumbar vein may drain into the left renal vein.


== Clinical significance ==

During central venous catheterisation of the inferior vena cava, the catheter may enter a lumbar vein. 

The catheter may need to be repositioned.
