GLUTEAL TUBEROSITY


The gluteal tuberosity is the lateral ridge above the linea aspera of the femur. 

It is the site of insertion of the gluteus maximus muscle.


== Structure ==

The gluteal tuberosity is the lateral ridge above the linea aspera on the posterior surface of the femur. 

It is very rough surface. 

It runs almost vertically upward to the base of the greater trochanter. 

Its upper part is often elongated into a roughened crest, where the third trochanter (a rounded tubercle) is occasionally developed.

The gluteal tuberosity is the main site of insertion the gluteus maximus muscle. 

The gluteus maximus muscle also inserts into the iliotibial tract.
