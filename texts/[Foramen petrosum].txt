[FORAMEN PETROSUM]

Inconstant foramen between the foramen ovale and the foramen spinosum for the lesser Petrosal nerve (also known as the small superficial petrosal nerve) that is the general visceral efferent (GVE) component of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), carrying parasympathetic preganglionic fibers from the tympanic plexus to the parotid gland. 

This lesser petrosal nerve synapses in the otic ganglion, from where the postganglionic fibers emerge.
