PARIETO-OCCIPITAL SULCUS


The parieto-occipital sulcus (also called the parieto-occipital fissure) is a deep sulcus in the cerebral cortex that marks the boundary between the cuneus and precuneus, and also between the parietal and occipital lobes. 

Only a small part can be seen on the lateral surface of the hemisphere, its chief part being on the medial surface.

The lateral part of the parieto-occipital sulcus is situated about 5 cm in front of the occipital pole of the hemisphere, and measures about 1.25 cm. in length.

The medial part of the parieto-occipital sulcus runs downward and forward as a deep cleft on the medial surface of the hemisphere, and joins the calcarine fissure below and behind the posterior end of the corpus callosum. 

In most cases, it contains a submerged gyrus.


== Function ==

The parieto-occipital lobe has been found in various neuroimaging studies, including PET (positron-emission-tomography) studies, and SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) studies, to be involved along with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during planning.
