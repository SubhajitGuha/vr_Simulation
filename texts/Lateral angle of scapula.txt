LATERAL ANGLE OF SCAPULA


The lateral angle of the scapula or glenoid angle also known as the head of the scapula is the thickest part of the scapula. 
    
It is broad and bears the glenoid cavity on its articular surface which is directed forward, laterally and slightly upwards, and articulates with the head of the humerus. 

The inferior angle is broader below than above and its vertical diameter is the longest. 

The surface is covered with cartilage in the fresh state; and its margins, slightly raised, give attachment to a fibrocartilaginous structure, the glenoidal labrum, which deepens the cavity. 

At its apex is a slight elevation, the supraglenoid tuberosity, to which the long head of the biceps brachii is attached.

The anatomic neck of the scapula is the slightly constricted portion which surrounds the head and is more distinct below and behind than above and in front. 

The surgical neck of the scapula passes directly medial to the base of the coracoid process.
