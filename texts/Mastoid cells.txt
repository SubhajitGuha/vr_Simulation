MASTOID CELLS

The mastoid cells (also called air cells of Lenoir or mastoid cells of Lenoir) are air-filled cavities within the mastoid process of the temporal bone of the cranium. 

The mastoid cells are a form of skeletal pneumaticity. 

Infection in these cells is called mastoiditis. 

The term "cells" refers to enclosed spaces, not cells as living, biological units.
