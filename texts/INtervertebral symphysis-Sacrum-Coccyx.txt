INTERVERTEBRAL SYMPHYSIS


An intervertebral disc (or intervertebral fibrocartilage) lies between adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column. 

Each disc forms a fibrocartilaginous joint (a symphysis), to allow slight movement of the vertebrae, to act as a ligament to hold the vertebrae together, and to function as a shock absorber for the spine.
