ELLIPSOID JOINT


A condyloid joint (also called condylar, ellipsoidal, or bicondylar) is an ovoid articular surface, or condyle that is received into an elliptical cavity. 

This permits movement in two planes, allowing flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction.


== Examples ==

Examples include:
the wrist-joint
metacarpophalangeal joints
metatarsophalangeal joints
atlanto-occipital jointsThese are also called ellipsoid joints. 

The oval-shaped condyle of one bone fits into the elliptical cavity of the other bone. 

These joints allow biaxial movementsâ€”i.e., forward and backward, or from side to side, but not rotation. 

Radiocarpal joint and Metacarpo-phalangeal joint are examples of condyloid joints.

An example of an Ellipsoid joint is the wrist; it functions similarly to the ball and socket joint except is unable to rotate 360 degrees; it prohibits axial rotation.
