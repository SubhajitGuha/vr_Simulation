GENIOGLOSSUS MUSCLE


The genioglossus is one of the paired extrinsic muscles of the tongue. The genioglossus is the major muscle responsible for protruding (or sticking out) the tongue.


== Structure ==

Genioglossus is the fan-shaped extrinsic tongue muscle that forms the majority of the body of the tongue. 

It arises from the mental spine of the mandible and its insertions are the hyoid bone and the bottom of the tongue.

The genioglossus is innervated by the hypoglossal nerve, as are all muscles of the tongue except for the palatoglossus. 

Blood is supplied to the sublingual branch of the lingual artery, a branch of the external carotid artery.

The canine genioglossus muscle has been divided into horizontal and oblique compartments.


== Function ==

The left and right genioglossus muscles protrude the tongue and deviate it towards the opposite side. 

When acting together, the muscles depress the center of the tongue at its back.


== Clinical significance ==

Contraction of the genioglossus stabilizes and enlarges the portion of the upper airway that is most vulnerable to collapse. 

Relaxation of the genioglossus and geniohyoideus muscles, especially during REM sleep, is implicated in obstructive sleep apnea. 

Given this connection, the mandible can be pulled forward to maximise the airway space, and prevent the tongue from sinking backwards under anaesthesia and obstructing the airway.

The genioglossus is often used as a proxy to test the function of the hypoglossal nerve, by asking a patient to stick out their tongue. 

Peripheral damage to the hypoglossal nerve can result in deviation of the tongue to the damaged side.
