SUPERIOR ANGLE OF SCAPULA


The superior angle of the scapula or medial angle, is covered by the trapezius muscle. 

This angle is formed by the junction of the superior and medial borders of the scapula. 

The superior angle is located at the approximate level of the second thoracic vertebra. 

The superior angle of the scapula is thin, smooth, rounded, and inclined somewhat lateralward, and gives attachment to a few fibers of the levator scapulae muscle.
