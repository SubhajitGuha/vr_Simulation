LATERAL CUNEIFORM BONE


There are three cuneiform ("wedge-shaped") bones in the human foot:

-the first or medial cuneiform
-the second or intermediate cuneiform, also known as the middle cuneiform
-the third or lateral cuneiform.

They are located between the navicular bone and the first, second and third metatarsal bones and are medial to the cuboid bone.


== Structure ==

The lateral cuneiform (also known as third cuneiform or external cuneiform) intermediate in size between the other two cuneiform bones, is also wedge-shaped, the base being uppermost. 

It occupies the center of the front row of the tarsal bones, between the intermediate cuneiform medially, the cuboid laterally, the navicular posteriorly and the third metatarsal in front. 

The tibialis posterior inserts at the medial cuneiform, while the flexor hallucis brevis originates from it.
