GREATER PELVIS


The greater pelvis (or "false pelvis") is the space enclosed by the pelvic girdle above and in front of the pelvic brim. 

It is bounded on either side by the ilium; in front it is incomplete, presenting a wide interval between the anterior borders of the ilia, which is filled by the muscles and fascia of the anterior abdominal wall; behind is a deep notch on either side between the ilium and the base of the sacrum that is filled by the thoracolumbar fascia and associated muscles.

It is generally considered part of the abdominal cavity (this is why it is sometimes called the false pelvis).

Some[who?] consider this region part of the pelvic cavity,[citation needed] while others reframe the classification question by calling the combination the abdominopelvic cavity.

The greater pelvis supports the intestines (specifically, the ileum and sigmoid colon), and transmits part of their weight to the anterior wall of the abdomen.

The femoral nerve from L2-L4 is in the greater pelvis, but not in the lesser pelvis.
