MANUBRIUM (OF STERNUM)


The manubrium (Latin for "handle") is the broad upper part of the sternum.

It has a quadrangular shape, narrowing from the top, which gives it four borders.

The suprasternal notch (jugular notch) is located in the middle at the upper broadest part of the manubrium.

This notch can be felt between the two clavicles.

On either side of this notch are the right and left clavicular notches.The manubrium joins with the body of the sternum, the clavicles and the cartilages of the first pair of ribs.

The inferior border, oval and rough, is covered with a thin layer of cartilage for articulation with the body.

The lateral borders are each marked above by a depression for the first costal cartilage, and below by a small facet, which, with a similar facet on the upper angle of the body, forms a notch for the reception of the costal cartilage of the second rib.

Between the depression for the first costal cartilage and the demi-facet for the second is a narrow, curved edge, which slopes from above downward towards the middle.

Also, the superior sternopericardial ligament attaches the pericardium to the posterior side of the manubrium.
