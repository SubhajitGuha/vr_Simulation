MANDIBULAR FOSSA

The mandibular fossa is the depression in the temporal bone that articulates with the mandible. 

In the temporal bone, the mandibular fossa is bounded anteriorly by the articular tubercle and posteriorly by the tympanic portion of the temporal bone, which separates it from the external acoustic meatus. 

The fossa is divided into two parts by a narrow slit, the petrotympanic fissure (Glaserian fissure).

It is also referred to as the glenoid fossa in dental literature.
