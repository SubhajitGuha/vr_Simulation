ISCHIOPUBIC RAMUS


The ischiopubic ramus is a compound structure consisting of the following two structures:

from the pubis, the inferior pubic ramus
from the ischium, the inferior ramus of the ischium.

It forms the inferior border of the obturator foramen and serves as part of the origin for the obturator internus and externus muscles. 

Also, most adductors originate at the ischiopubic ramus.

It also marks a vertex of the anal triangle and the urogenital triangle.
The fascia of Colles is attached to its margin.
