ILIOPSOAS FASCIA/
ILIAC FASCIA


The iliac fascia, or Abernethy's fascia, is a fascia in the region of the ilium of the pelvis.

It has the following connections:

-laterally, to the whole length of the inner lip of the iliac crest.
medially, to the linea terminalis of the lesser pelvis, where it is continuous with the periosteum.

-At the iliopectineal eminence it receives the tendon of insertion of the Psoas minor, when that muscle exists.

-Lateral to the femoral vessels it is intimately connected to the posterior margin of the inguinal ligament, and is continuous with the transversalis fascia.

-Immediately lateral to the femoral vessels the iliac fascia is prolonged backward and medialward from the inguinal ligament as a band, the iliopectineal fascia, which is attached to the iliopectineal eminence.

This fascia divides the space between the inguinal ligament and the hip bone into two lacun√¶ or compartments:

-the medial vascular lacuna transmits the femoral vessels.
-the lateral muscular lacuna transmits the Psoas major and Iliacus and the femoral nerve.Medial to the vessels the iliac fascia is attached to the pectineal line behind the conjoint tendon, where it is again continuous with the transversalis fascia.
