PTERYGOSPINOUS LIGAMENT


The pterygospinous ligament stretches from the upper part of the posterior border of the lateral pterygoid plate to the spinous process of the sphenoid.


== Structure ==

=== Variation ===

It occasionally ossifies, and in such cases, between its upper border and the base of the skull, a foramen is formed - pterygospinous foramen (Civinini) which transmits the branches of the mandibular nerve to the muscles of mastication.
