JUGULAR PROCESS


In the lateral part of the occipital bone, extending lateralward from the posterior half of the condyle is a quadrilateral or triangular plate of bone, the jugular process, excavated in front by the jugular notch, which, in the articulated skull, forms the posterior part of the jugular foramen.  The lateral side is divided from the medial side by the intrajugular process of occipital bone.
It serves as the insertion of the rectus capitis lateralis.
