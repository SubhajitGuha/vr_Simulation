GROOVE FOR SUPERIOR SAGITTAL SINUS

The internal surface of the squama frontalis of the frontal bone is concave and presents in the upper part of the middle line a vertical groove, the sagittal sulcus, the edges of which unite below to form a ridge, the frontal crest; the sulcus lodges the superior sagittal sinus, while its margins and the crest afford attachment to the falx cerebri.

It also is part of the parietal, and occipital bones.
