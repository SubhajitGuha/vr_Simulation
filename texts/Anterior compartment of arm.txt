ANTERIOR COMPARTMENT OF ARM


The anterior compartment of the arm is also known as the flexor compartment of the arm as its main action is that of flexion. 

The anterior compartment is one of the two anatomic compartments of the upper arm, the other being the posterior compartment.

The anterior compartment contains three muscles: 
-the biceps brachii, 
-the brachialis and 
-the coracobrachialis. 

These muscles are all innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve which arises from the fifth and sixth and seventh cervical spinal nerves. 

The blood supply is from the brachial artery.
