INFRATEMPORAL CREST


The lateral surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid is convex, and divided by a transverse ridge, the infratemporal crest, into two portions.
The superior or temporal portion, convex from above downward, concave from before backward, forms a part of the temporal fossa, and gives attachment to the Temporalis; the inferior or infratemporal, smaller in size and concave, enters into the formation of the infratemporal fossa, and, together with the infratemporal crest, affords attachment to the Pterygoideus externus.
