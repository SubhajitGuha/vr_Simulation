BODY OF TIBIA


The shaft or body of the tibia is triangular in cross-section and forms three borders: An anterior, medial and lateral or interosseous border. 

These three borders form three surfaces; the medial, lateral and posterior.

The forward flat part of the tibia is called the fibia, often confused with the fibula.
