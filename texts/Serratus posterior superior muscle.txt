SERRATUS POSTERIOR SUPERIOR MUSCLE


The serratus posterior superior muscle is a thin, quadrilateral muscle. 

It is situated at the upper back part of the thorax, deep to the rhomboid muscles.


== Structure ==

The serratus posterior superior muscle arises by an aponeurosis from the lower part of the nuchal ligament, from the spinous processes of C7, T1, T2, and sometimes T3, and from the supraspinal ligament. 

It is inserted, by four fleshy digitations into the upper borders of the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs past the angle of the rib.


== Function ==

The serratus posterior superior muscle elevates the second to fifth ribs. 

This aids deep respiration.
