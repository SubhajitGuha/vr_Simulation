HEAD OF RIB


The head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra with which it articulates. 

It is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. 

The upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above, and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra with the same number. 

The transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the same number. 

The crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.
