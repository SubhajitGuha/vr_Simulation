TRIANGULAR PART OF INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS


Triangular part of inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis), (cortex between the ascending ramus and the horizontal ramus of the lateral sulcus). 

It may be associated with the ability to translate from a secondary or tertiary language back to one's native language.

The triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus is known as Brodmann area 45 (BA45), and the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus is known as Brodmann area 47.
