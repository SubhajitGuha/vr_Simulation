POSTERIOR INTERCONDYLAR AREA


Posteriorly, the condyles are separated from each other by a shallow depression, the posterior intercondyloid fossa, which gives attachment to part of the posterior cruciate ligament of the knee-joint. 

The medial condyle presents posteriorly a deep transverse groove, for the insertion of the tendon of the semimembranosus.
