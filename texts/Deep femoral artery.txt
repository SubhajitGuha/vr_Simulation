DEEP FEMORAL ARTERY


The deep artery of the thigh, (profunda femoris artery or deep femoral artery) is a large branch of the femoral artery. 

It travels more deeply (posteriorly) than the rest of the femoral artery.


== Structure ==

The deep artery of the thigh branches off the posterolateral side of the femoral artery soon after its origin. 

It travels down the thigh closer to the femur than the femoral artery. 

It runs between the pectineus muscle and the adductor longus muscle. 

It runs on the posterior side of adductor longus muscle. 

It pierces the adductor magnus muscle, and may be known as the fourth perforating artery as it continues. 

The deep femoral artery does not leave the thigh.


=== Branches ===

The deep artery of the thigh gives off the following branches:

Lateral circumflex femoral artery.

Medial circumflex femoral artery.

3 Perforating arteries - perforate the adductor magnus muscle to the posterior and medial compartments of the thigh to connect with the branches of the popliteal artery behind the knee.


== Function ==

The deep artery of the thigh is the main supply of oxygenated blood to the thigh.
