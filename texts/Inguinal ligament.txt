INGUINAL LIGAMENT


The inguinal ligament (), also known as Poupart's ligament or groin ligament, is a band running from the pubic tubercle to the anterior superior iliac spine. 

It forms the base of the inguinal canal through which an indirect inguinal hernia may develop.


== Structure ==

The inguinal ligament runs from the anterior superior iliac crest of the ilium to the pubic tubercle of the pubic bone. 

It is formed by the external abdominal oblique aponeurosis and is continuous with the fascia lata of the thigh.
There is some dispute over the attachments.Structures that pass deep to the inguinal ligament include:

Psoas major, iliacus, pectineus
Femoral nerve, artery, and vein
Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh
Lymphatics


== Function ==

The ligament serves to contain soft tissues as they course anteriorly from the trunk to the lower extremity. 

This structure demarcates the superior border of the femoral triangle. 

It demarcates the inferior border of the inguinal triangle.

The midpoint of the inguinal ligament, halfway between the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle, is the landmark for the femoral nerve.

The mid-inguinal point, halfway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic symphysis, is the landmark for the femoral artery.

The external iliac arteries pass the inguinal ligament posteriorly and inferiorly.


== History ==

It is also referred to as Poupart's ligament, because Fran√ßois Poupart gave it relevance in relation to hernial repair, calling it "the suspender of the abdomen" (French: "le suspenseur de l'abdomen"). 

It is sometimes termed the Fallopian ligament. 

Colles' ligament is the reflex ligament and not the inguinal ligament.
