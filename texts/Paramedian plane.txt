PARAMEDIAN PLANE


The term parasagittal is used to describe any plane parallel or adjacent to a given sagittal plane.
    
    Specific named parasagittal planes include:
        The midclavicular line crosses through the clavicle.
        Lateral sternal and parasternal planes.

The term sagittal is derived from the Latin word 'sagitta', meaning 'arrow'. 

An image of an arrow piercing a body and passing from front (anterior) to back (posterior) on a parabolic trajectory would be one way to demonstrate the derivation of the term. 

Another explanation would be the notching of the sagittal suture posteriorly by the lambdoidal suture â€”similar to feathers on an arrow.
