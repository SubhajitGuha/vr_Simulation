ANTERIOR STERNOCLAVICULAR LIGAMENT


The anterior sternoclavicular ligament is a broad band of fibers, covering the anterior (front) surface of the joint between the sternum and clavicle (sternoclavicular articulation).

It is attached above to the upper and front part of the sternal end of the clavicle, and, passing obliquely downward and medialward, is attached below to the front of the upper part of the manubrium on the sternum.

This ligament is covered by the sternal portion of the sternocleidomastoideus and the integument; behind, it is in relation with the capsule, the articular disk, and the two synovial membranes.
