FEMORAL BRANCH OF GENITOFEMORAL NERVE


The femoral branch passes underneath the inguinal ligament, travelling through the lateral muscular compartment of the femoral canal where it innervates skin of the upper leg. 

Passing through the cribriform fascia of the saphenous opening of the fascia lata of the thigh, it then supplies the skin of the upper, anterior and medial side of thigh.
