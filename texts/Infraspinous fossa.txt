INFRASPINOUS FOSSA
/INFRASPINATOUS FOSSA


The infraspinatous fossa (infraspinatus fossa, infraspinous fossa) of the scapula is much larger than the supraspinatous fossa; toward its vertebral margin a shallow concavity is seen at its upper part; its center presents a prominent convexity, while near the axillary border is a deep groove which runs from the upper toward the lower part.

The medial two-thirds of the fossa give origin to the Infraspinatus; the lateral third is covered by this muscle.
