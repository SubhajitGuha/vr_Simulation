INTEROSSEUS CREST OF FIBULA


The antero-medial border, or interosseous crest, is situated close to the medial side of the preceding, and runs nearly parallel with it in the upper third of its extent, but diverges from it in the lower two-thirds. 

It begins above just beneath the head of the bone (sometimes it is quite indistinct for about 2.5 cm. below the head), and ends at the apex of a rough triangular surface immediately above the articular facet of the lateral malleolus. 

It serves for the attachment of the interosseous membrane, which separates the extensor muscles in front from the flexor muscles behind.
