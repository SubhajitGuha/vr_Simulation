SUPERFICIAL BRANCH OF ULNAR NERVE


The superficial branch of the ulnar nerve is a terminal branch of the ulnar nerve.

It supplies the palmaris brevis and the skin on the ulnar side of the hand.

It also divides into a common palmar digital nerve and a proper palmar digital nerve.

The proper digital branches are distributed to the fingers in the same manner as those of the median nerve.
