PELVIC GIRDLE


The pelvic skeleton, or pelvic girdle, is formed posteriorly (in the area of the back), by the sacrum and the coccyx and laterally and anteriorly (forward and to the sides), by a pair of hip bones. 

Each hip bone consists of 3 sections, ilium, ischium, and pubis. 

During childhood, these sections are separate bones, joined by the triradiate cartilage. 

During puberty, they fuse together to form a single bone.
