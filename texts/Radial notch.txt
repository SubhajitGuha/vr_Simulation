RADIAL NOTCH


The radial notch of the ulna (lesser sigmoid cavity) is a narrow, oblong, articular depression on the lateral side of the coronoid process; it receives the circumferential articular surface of the head of the radius.

It is concave from before backward, and its prominent extremities serve for the attachment of the annular ligament.
