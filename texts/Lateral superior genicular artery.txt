LATERAL SUPERIOR GENICULAR ARTERY


The lateral superior genicular artery is a branch of the popliteal artery that supplies a portion of the knee joint.


== Course ==

It passes above the lateral condyle of the femur, beneath the tendon of the Biceps femoris.


== Branching ==

It divides into a superficial and a deep branch; the superficial branch supplies the vastus lateralis, and anastomoses with the descending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex and the lateral inferior genicular arteries; the deep branch supplies the lower part of the femur and knee-joint, and forms an anastomotic arch across the front of the bone with the highest genicular and the medial inferior genicular arteries.
