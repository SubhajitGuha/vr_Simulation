PALATOVAGINAL CANAL

The palatovaginal canal (also pharyngeal canal) is a canal between the sphenoid bone and the palatine bone that connects the nasopharynx with the pterygopalatine fossa. 

It transmits the pharyngeal branch of the third part of the maxillary artery (not to be confused with the ascending pharyngeal artery, a branch of external carotid). 

An inconstant vomerovaginal canal may lie between the ala of the vomer and the vaginal process of the sphenoid bone, medial to the palatovaginal canal, and lead into the anterior end of the palatovaginal canal.
