ANTEROMEDIAL SURFACE OF HUMERUS


The antero-medial surface, less extensive than the antero-lateral, is directed medialward above, forward and medialward below.

Its upper part is narrow, and forms the floor of the intertubercular groove which gives insertion to the tendon of the latissimus dorsi muscle.

Its middle part is slightly rough for the attachment of some of the fibers of the tendon of insertion of the coracobrachialis muscle; 

Its lower part is smooth, concave from above downward, and gives origin to the brachialis muscle.
