LEVATOR LABII SUPERIORIS ALAEQUE NASI MUSCLE


The levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle is, translated from Latin, the "lifter of both the upper lip and of the wing of the nose". 

It has the longest name of any muscle in an animal. 

The muscle is attached to the upper frontal process of the maxilla and inserts into the skin of the lateral part of the nostril and upper lip.


== Overview ==

Historically known as Otto's muscle, it dilates the nostril and elevates the upper lip, enabling one to snarl. 

Elvis Presley is famous for his use of this expression, earning the muscle's nickname "The Elvis muscle". 

A mnemonic to remember its name is, "Little Ladies Snore All Night."  Snore- because it is the labial elevator closest to the nose.

The levator labii superioris alaeque nasi is sometimes referred to as the "angular head" of the levator labii superioris muscle.
