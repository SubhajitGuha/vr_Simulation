ENDOCHONDRAL BONE

Endochondral ossification is one of the two essential processes during fetal development of the mammalian skeletal system by which bone tissue is created. 

Unlike intramembranous ossification, which is the other process by which bone tissue is created, cartilage is present during endochondral ossification. 

Endochondral ossification is also an essential process during the rudimentary formation of long bones, the growth of the length of long bones, and the natural healing of bone fractures.
