SIGMOID ARTERIES


The sigmoid arteries, two or three in number, run obliquely downward and to the left behind the peritoneum and in front of the psoas major, ureter, and internal spermatic vessels. 

They originate from the inferior mesenteric artery branch of the abdominal aorta.

Their branches supply the lower part of the descending colon, the iliac colon, and the sigmoid or pelvic colon; anastomosing above with the left colic, and below with the superior hemorrhoidal artery.
