SUPERIOR PARIETAL LOBULE


The superior parietal lobule is bounded in front by the upper part of the postcentral sulcus, but is usually connected with the postcentral gyrus above the end of the sulcus. 

The superior parietal lobule contains Brodmann's areas 5 and 7.

Behind it is the lateral part of the parietooccipital fissure, around the end of which it is joined to the occipital lobe by a curved gyrus, the arcus parietooccipitalis. 

Below, it is separated from the inferior parietal lobule by the horizontal portion of the intraparietal sulcus.

The superior parietal lobule is involved with spatial orientation, and receives a great deal of visual input as well as sensory input from one's hand. 

It is also involved with other functions of the parietal lobe in general.

There are major white matter pathway connections with the superior parietal lobule such as the Cingulum, SLF I, superior parietal lobule connections of the Medial longitudinal fasciculus and other newly described superior parietal white matter connections.

Damage to the superior parietal lobule can cause contralateral astereognosis and hemispatial neglect. 

It is also associated with deficits on tests involving the manipulation and rearrangement of information in working memory, but not on working memory tests requiring only rehearsal and retrieval processes.
