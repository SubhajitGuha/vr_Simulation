FLEXION


Flexion describes a bending movement that decreases the angle between a segment and its proximal segment.

For example, bending the elbow, or clenching a hand into a fist, are examples of flexion. When a person is sitting down, the knees are flexed. 

When a joint can move forward and backward, such as the neck and trunk, flexion is movement in the anterior direction.

When the chin is against the chest, the neck is flexed, and the trunk is flexed when a person leans forward.

Flexion of the shoulder or hip is movement of the arm or leg forward.
