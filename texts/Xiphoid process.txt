XIPHOID PROCESS


Located at the inferior end of the sternum is the pointed xiphoid process.

Improperly performed chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation can cause the xiphoid process to snap off, driving it into the liver which can cause a fatal hemorrhage.

The sternum is composed of highly vascular tissue, covered by a thin layer of compact bone which is thickest in the manubrium between the articular facets for the clavicles.

The inferior sternopericardial ligament attaches the pericardium to the posterior xiphoid process.
