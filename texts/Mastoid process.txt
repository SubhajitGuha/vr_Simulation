MASTOID PROCESS

The mastoid part of the temporal bone is the posterior (back) part of the temporal bone, one of the bones of the skull. 

Its rough surface gives attachment to various muscles (via tendons) and it has openings for blood vessels. 

From its borders, the mastoid part articulates with two other bones.
