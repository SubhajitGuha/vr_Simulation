INFERIOR ANGLE OF SCAPULA


The inferior angle of the scapula is the lowest part of the scapula and is covered by the latissimus dorsi muscle. 

It moves forwards round the chest when the arm is abducted. 

The inferior angle is formed by the union of the medial and lateral borders of the scapula. 

It is thick and rough and its posterior or back surface affords attachment to the teres major and often to a few fibers of the latissimus dorsi. 

The anatomical plane that passes vertically through the inferior angle is named the scapular line.
