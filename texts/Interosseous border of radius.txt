INTEROSSEOUS BORDER OF RADIUS


The interosseous border (internal border; crista interossea; interosseous crest;) begins above, at the back part of the tuberosity, and its upper part is rounded and indistinct; it becomes sharp and prominent as it descends, and at its lower part divides into two ridges which are continued to the anterior and posterior margins of the ulnar notch. 

To the posterior of the two ridges the lower part of the interosseous membrane is attached, while the triangular surface between the ridges gives insertion to part of the pronator quadratus muscle. 

This crest separates the volar from the dorsal surface, and gives attachment to the interosseous membrane.  

The connection between the two bones is actually a joint referred to as a syndesmosis joint.
