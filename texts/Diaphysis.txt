DIAPHYSIS

The diaphysis is the main or midsection (shaft) of a long bone.

It is made up of cortical bone and usually contains bone marrow and adipose tissue (fat).

It is a middle tubular part composed of compact bone which surrounds a central marrow cavity which contains red or yellow marrow. 

In diaphysis, primary ossification occurs.
