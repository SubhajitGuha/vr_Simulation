TRUE RIBS


The first seven sets of ribs, known as "true ribs", are attached to the sternum by the costal cartilages. 

The first rib is unique and easier to distinguish than other ribs. 

It is a short, flat, C-shaped bone, and attaches to the manubrium. 

The vertebral attachment can be found just below the neck at the first thoracic vertebra, and the majority of this bone can be found above the level of the clavicle. 

Ribs 2 through 7 then become longer and less curved as they progress downwards.
