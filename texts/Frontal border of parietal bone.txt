FRONTAL BORDER OF PARIETAL BONE


The frontal border is deeply serrated, and bevelled at the expense of the outer surface above and of the inner below; it articulates with the frontal bone, forming half of the coronal suture. 

The point where the coronal suture intersects with the sagittal suture forms a T-shape and is called the bregma.
