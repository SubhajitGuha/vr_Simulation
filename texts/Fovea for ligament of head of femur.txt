FOVEA FOR LIGAMENT OF HEAD OF FEMUR/FOVEA CAPITIS


The fovea capitis is a small, concave depression within the head of the femur that serves as an attachment point for the ligamentum teres (Saladin). 

It is slightly ovoid in shape and is oriented "superior-to-posteroinferior. 

(Cerezal)" This orientation is said to be favorable for the tensed fibers of the ligamentum teres. 

The fovea capitis is located "slightly posterior and inferior to the center of the articular surface of the femoral head (Cerezal)" 

Furthermore, unlike the head of the femur, the fovea capitis lacks any hyaline cartilage. 

The fovea capitis is said to contain vascular canals in two-thirds of individuals, but "their contribution to femoral head vascularity varies. (Cerezal)"
