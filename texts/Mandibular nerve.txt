MANDIBULAR NERVE


The mandibular nerve (V3) is the largest of the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve, the fifth cranial nerve (CN V).


== Structure ==

The large sensory root emerges from the lateral part of the trigeminal ganglion and exits the cranial cavity through the foramen ovale. 

Portio minor, the small motor root of the trigeminal nerve, passes under the trigeminal ganglion and through the foramen ovale to unite with the sensory root just outside the skull.

The mandibular nerve immediately passes between tensor veli palatini, which is medial, and lateral pterygoid, which is lateral, and gives off a meningeal branch (nervus spinosus) and the nerve to medial pterygoid from its medial side. 

The nerve then divides into a small anterior and large posterior trunk.

The anterior division gives off branches to three major muscles of mastication and a buccal branch which is sensory to the cheek. 

The posterior division gives off three main sensory branches, the auriculotemporal, lingual and inferior alveolar nerves and motor fibres to supply mylohyoid and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle.


=== Branches ===

The mandibular nerve gives off the following branches:

From the main trunk of the nerve (before the division)
-muscular branches, which are efferent nerves for the medial pterygoid, tensor tympani, and tensor veli palatini muscles (motor)
-meningeal branch (a sensory nerve)

From the anterior division
-masseteric nerve (motor)
-deep temporal nerves, anterior and posterior (motor)
-buccal nerve (a sensory nerve)
-lateral pterygoid nerve (motor)

From the posterior division
-auriculotemporal nerve (a sensory nerve)
-lingual nerve (a sensory nerve)
-inferior alveolar nerve (which gives off a motor nerve and a sensory nerve)
-mental nerve (sensory branch) and the nerve to mylohyoid (motor branch)
