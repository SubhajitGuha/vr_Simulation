MAXILLA

The maxilla (plural: maxillae) in vertebrates is the upper fixed (not fixed in Neopterygii) bone of the jaw formed from the fusion of two maxillary bones. 

In humans, the upper jaw includes the hard palate in the front of the mouth.

The two maxillary bones are fused at the intermaxillary suture, forming the anterior nasal spine. 

This is similar to the mandible (lower jaw), which is also a fusion of two mandibular bones at the mandibular symphysis. 

The mandible is the movable part of the jaw.
