OCCIPITAL BORDER OF PARIETAL BONE


The occipital border, deeply denticulated (finely toothed), articulates with the occipital bone, forming half of the lambdoid suture. 

That point where the sagittal suture intersects the lambdoid suture is called the lambda, because of its resemblance to the Greek letter.
