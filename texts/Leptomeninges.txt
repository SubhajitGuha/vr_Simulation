LEPTOMENINGES


The arachnoid and pia mater together are sometimes called the leptomeninges, literally "thin meninges" (Greek: λεπτός "leptos"—"thin"). 

Acute meningococcal meningitis can lead to an exudate within the leptomeninges along the surface of the brain.

Because the arachnoid is connected to the pia by cob-web like strands, it is structurally continuous with the pia, hence the name pia-arachnoid or leptomeninges. 

They are responsible for the production of beta-trace protein (prostaglandin D2 synthase), a major cerebrospinal fluid protein.
