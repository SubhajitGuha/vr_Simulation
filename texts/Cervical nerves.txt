CERVICAL NERVES


The cervical nerves are the spinal nerves from the cervical vertebrae in the cervical segment of the spinal cord. 

Although there are seven cervical vertebrae (C1-C7), there are eight cervical nerves C1–C8. C1–C7 emerge above their corresponding vertebrae, while C8 emerges below the C7 vertebra. 

Everywhere else in the spine, the nerve emerges below the vertebra with the same name.

The posterior distribution includes the suboccipital nerve (C1), the greater occipital nerve (C2) and the third occipital nerve (C3). 

The anterior distribution includes the cervical plexus (C1-C4) and brachial plexus (C5-T1).

The cervical nerves innervate the sternohyoid, sternothyroid and omohyoid muscles.

A loop of nerves called ansa cervicalis is part of the cervical plexus.
