FACIAL BONES


The facial skeleton comprises the facial bones that may attach to build a portion of the skull. The remainder of the skull is the braincase.

In human anatomy and development, the facial skeleton is sometimes called the membranous viscerocranium, which comprises the mandible and dermatocranial elements that are not part of the braincase. 

In the human skull, the facial skeleton consists of fourteen bones in the face:

    Inferior turbinal (2)
    Lacrimal bones (2)
    Mandible
    Maxilla (2)
    Nasal bones (2)
    Palatine bones (2)
    Vomer
    Zygomatic bones (2)
