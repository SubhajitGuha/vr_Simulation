DORSIFLEXION


Dorsiflexion is where the toes are brought closer to the shin. 

This decreases the angle between the dorsum of the foot and the leg.

For example, when walking on the heels the ankle is described as being in dorsiflexion.

Dorsiflexion and plantar flexion refer to extension or flexion of the foot at the ankle. 

These terms refer to flexion in direction of the "back" of the foot, which is the upper surface of the foot when standing, and flexion in direction of the sole of the foot. 

These terms are used to resolve confusion, as technically extension of the joint is dorsiflexion, which could be considered counter-intuitive as the motion reduces the angle between the foot and the leg.
