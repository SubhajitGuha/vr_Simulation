ILIAC TUBEROSITY


Behind the iliac fossa is a rough surface, divided into two portions, an anterior and a posterior. 

The posterior portion, known as the iliac tuberosity, is elevated and rough, for the attachment of the posterior sacroiliac ligaments and for the origins of the Sacrospinalis and Multifidus.
