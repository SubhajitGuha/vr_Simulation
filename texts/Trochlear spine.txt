TROCHLEAR SPINE


The inferior surface of each orbital plate is smooth and concave, and presents, laterally, under cover of the zygomatic process, a shallow depression, the lacrimal fossa, for the lacrimal gland; near the nasal part is a depression, the fovea trochlearis, or occasionally a small TROCHLEAR SPINE, for the attachment of the cartilaginous pulley of the obliquus oculi superior.
