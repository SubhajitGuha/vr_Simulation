ANTERIOR BORDER OF HUMERUS


It runs from the front of the greater tubercle above to the coronoid fossa below, separating the antero-medial from the antero-lateral surface. 

Its upper part is a prominent ridge, the crest of the greater tubercle; it serves for the insertion of the tendon of the pectoralis major muscle. 

About its center it forms the anterior boundary of the deltoid tuberosity, on which the deltoid muscle attaches; below, it is smooth and rounded, affording attachment to the brachialis muscle.
