DEEP PART OF POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT OF LEG


-FLEXOR HALLUCIS LONGUS MUSCLE

    -Origin: Inferior two-thirds of posterior surface of fibula; inferior part of interosseous membrane 	
    -Insertion: Base of distal phalanx of big toe (hallux) 	
    -Innervation: Tibial nerve (S1, S2)
    -Main action: Flexes big toe at all joints; weakly plantarflexes ankle; supports medial longitudinal arch of foot 
    
    
-TIBIALIS POSTERIOR MUSCLE

    -Origin: Interosseous membrane; posterior surface of tibia inferior to soleal line; posterior surface of fibula
    -Insertion: Tuberosity of navicular, cuneiform, cuboid, and sustentaculum tali of calcaneus; bases of 2nd, 3rd, and 4th metatarsals
    -Innervation: Tibial nerve (L4, L5)
    -Main action: Plantarflexes ankle; inverts foot 
    
    
-FLEXOR DIGITORUM LONGUS MUSCLE:
    
    -Origin: Medial part of posterior surface of tibia; by a broad tendon to fibula
    -Insertion: Bases of distal phalanges of lateral four digits 	
    -Innervation: Tibial nerve (S1, S2)
    -Main action: Flexes lateral four digits; plantarflexes ankle; supports longitudinal arches of foot 
    
    
-POPLITEUS MUSCLE:
    
 	-Origin: Lateral surface of lateral condyle of femur and lateral meniscus
    -Insertion: Posterior surface of tibia, superior to soleal line 
    -Innervation: Tibial nerve (L4, L5, S1)
    -Action: Weakly flexes knee and unlocks it by rotating femur 5 deg on fixed tibia; medially rotates tibia of unplanted limb 
    
    
Blood supply:
-------------
    Posterior tibial artery.

Innervation:
------------
    The posterior compartment of the leg is supplied by the tibial nerve.

Function:
---------
    It contains the plantar flexors.
