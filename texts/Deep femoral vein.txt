DEEP FEMORAL VEIN


The profunda femoris vein, (or deep femoral vein) is a large deep vein in the thigh. 

It receives blood from the inner thigh and proceeds superiorly and medially running alongside the profunda femoris artery to join with the femoral vein approximately at the level of the inferior-most portion of the ischial tuberosity.


== Function ==

The deep vein of the thigh drains the inner thigh. 

It contributes the largest volume of blood entering the femoral vein.


== Clinical significance ==

The deep vein of the thigh is commonly affected by phlebitis which can be a dangerous condition in the case of a thrombus, or blood clot, forming, as the thrombus may dislodge and travel to the lungs, causing pulmonary embolism. 

This is a possible complication of immobility due to excessive bed rest following a surgery or disability, an excessively sedentary lifestyle or hereditary dispositions such as the factor V Leiden mutation.
