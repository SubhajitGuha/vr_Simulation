MEDIAL CUNEIFORM BONE


There are three cuneiform ("wedge-shaped") bones in the human foot:

the first or medial cuneiform
the second or intermediate cuneiform, also known as the middle cuneiform
the third or lateral cuneiformThey are located between the navicular bone and the first, second and third metatarsal bones and are medial to the cuboid bone.


== Structure ==

There are three cuneiform bones:

The medial cuneiform (also known as first cuneiform) is the largest of the cuneiforms. 

It is situated at the medial side of the foot, anterior to the navicular bone and posterior to the base of the first metatarsal. 

It articulates with four bones: the navicular, second cuneiform, and first and second metatarsals. 

The tibialis anterior and fibularis longus muscle inserts at the medial cuneiform bone.

The tibialis posterior inserts at the medial cuneiform, while the flexor hallucis brevis originates from it.

Lateral to it is the intermediate cuneiform.
