ANGULAR ARTERY


The angular artery is the terminal part of the facial artery; it ascends to the medial angle of the eye's orbit, imbedded in the fibers of the angular head of the quadratus labii superioris, and accompanied by the angular vein.

On the cheek it distributes branches which anastomose with the infraorbital; after supplying the lacrimal sac and orbicularis oculi, it ends by anastomosing with the dorsal nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery.
