CHONDROGLOSSUS


The chondroglossus is a muscle sometimes described as a part of the hyoglossus, but is separated from it by fibers of the genioglossus, which pass to the side of the pharynx.
It is about 2 cm long, and arises from the medial side and base of the lesser cornu and contiguous portion of the body of the hyoid bone, and passes directly upward to blend with the intrinsic muscular fibers of the tongue, between the hyoglossus and genioglossus.
