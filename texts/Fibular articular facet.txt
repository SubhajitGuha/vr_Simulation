FIBULAR ARTICULAR FACET


The tibiofibular joints are the articulations between the tibia and fibula which allows very little movement.

The proximal tibiofibular joint is a small plane joint. 

The joint is formed between the undersurface of the lateral tibial condyle and the head of fibula. 

The joint capsule is reinforced by anterior and posterior ligament of the head of the fibula.
