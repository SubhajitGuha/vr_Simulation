LEVATOR VELI PALATINI


The levator veli palatini () is the elevator muscle of the soft palate in the human body. During swallowing, it contracts, elevating the soft palate to help prevent food from entering the nasopharynx. It is innervated via the pharyngeal plexus.
The levator veli palatini (Levator palati) is a thick, rounded muscle situated lateral to the choan√¶.
It arises from the under surface of the apex of the petrous part of the temporal bone and from the medial lamina of the cartilage of the auditory tube.
After passing above the upper concave margin of the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle it spreads out in the palatine velum, its fibers extending obliquely downward and medially to the middle line, where they blend with those of the opposite side.
