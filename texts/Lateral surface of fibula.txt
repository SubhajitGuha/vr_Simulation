LATERAL SURFACE OF FIBULA


The lateral surface is the space between the antero-lateral and postero-lateral borders. 

It is broad, and often deeply grooved; it is directed lateralward in the upper two-thirds of its course, backward in the lower third, where it is continuous with the posterior border of the lateral malleolus. 

This surface gives origin to the peronaei longus and brevis.
