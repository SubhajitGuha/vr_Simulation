ANTERIOR SURFACE OF RADIUS


The volar surface (facies volaris; anterior surface) is concave in its upper three-fourths, and gives origin to the flexor pollicis longus muscle; it is broad and flat in its lower fourth, and affords insertion to the Pronator quadratus. 

A prominent ridge limits the insertion of the Pronator quadratus below, and between this and the inferior border is a triangular rough surface for the attachment of the volar radiocarpal ligament. 

At the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the volar surface is the nutrient foramen, which is directed obliquely upward.
