INTEROSSEOUS BORDER/CREST OF ULNA


The interosseous crest (crista interossea; external or interosseous border) begins above by the union of two lines, which converge from the extremities of the radial notch and enclose between them a triangular space for the origin of part of the Supinator; it ends below at the head of the ulna. 

Its upper part is sharp, its lower fourth smooth and rounded. 

This crest gives attachment to the interosseous membrane, and separates the volar from the dorsal surface.
