BODY OF PUBIS


The body forms the wide, strong, middle and flat part of the pubic bone.

The bodies of the left and right pubic bones join together at the pubic symphysis.

The rough upper edge is the pubic crest, ending laterally in the pubic tubercle.

This tubercle, found roughly 3 cm from the pubic symphysis, is a distinctive feature on the lower part of the abdominal wall; important when localizing the superficial inguinal ring and the femoral canal of the inguinal canal.

The inner surface of the body forms part of the wall of the lesser pelvis and joints to the origin of a part of the obturator internus muscle.
