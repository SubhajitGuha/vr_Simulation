DESCENDING BRANCH OF LATERAL CIRCUMFLEX FEMORAL ARTERY


The descending branch of lateral circumflex femoral artery runs downward, behind the rectus femoris, upon the vastus lateralis, to which it gives offsets; one long branch descends in the muscle as far as the knee, and anastomoses with the superior lateral genicular artery. 

It is accompanied by the branch of the femoral nerve to the vastus lateralis muscle.
