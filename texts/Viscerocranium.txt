    In human anatomy and development, 
viscerocranium usually refers to elements of the skull that are not part of the braincase (as opposed to the neurocranium), and which can be subdivided into:
     
        -The membranous viscerocranium, comprising the facial skeleton
      
        -The cartilaginous viscerocranium, comprising the splanchnocranium
    
    In comparative anatomy of vertebrates, 
viscerocranium usually refers specifically to the splanchnocranium (as opposed to the endocranium and dermatocranium).
