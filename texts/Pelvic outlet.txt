PELVIC OUTLET


The lower circumference of the lesser pelvis is very irregular; the space enclosed by it is named the inferior aperture or pelvic outlet. 

It is an important component of pelvimetry.


== Boundaries ==

It has the following boundaries:

Anteriorly: the pubic arch
Laterally: the ischial tuberosities
Posterolaterally: the inferior margin of the sacrotuberous ligament
Posteriorly: the anterior border of the middle of the coccyx.


== Notches ==

These eminences are separated by three notches: 

one in front, the pubic arch, formed by the convergence of the inferior rami of the ischium and pubis on either side.

The other notches, one on either side, are formed by the sacrum and coccyx behind, the ischium in front, and the ilium above; they are called the sciatic notches; in the natural state they are converted into foramina by the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments.


== In situ ==

When the ligaments are in situ, the inferior aperture of the pelvis is lozenge-shaped, bounded as follows:

In front, by the pubic arcuate ligament and the inferior rami of the pubes and ischia
Laterally, by the ischial tuberosities
Behind, by the sacrotuberous ligaments and the tip of the coccyx.
