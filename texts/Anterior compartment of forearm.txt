ANTERIOR COMPARTMENT OF (THE) FOREARM


The anterior compartment of the forearm (or flexor compartment) contains the following muscles:
    
The muscles are largely involved with flexion and pronation. 

The superficial muscles have their origin on the common flexor tendon. 

The ulnar nerve and artery are also contained within this compartment. 

The flexor digitorum superficialis lies in between the other four muscles of the superficial group and the three muscles of the deep group. 

This is why it is also classified as the intermediate group.
