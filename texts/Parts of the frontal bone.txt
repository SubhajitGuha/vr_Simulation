PARTS OF THE FRONTAL BONE

The frontal bone is made up of two main parts. 

These are the squamous part, and the orbital part. 

    -The squamous part marks the vertical, flat, and also the biggest part, and the main region of the forehead. 

    -The orbital part is the horizontal and second biggest region of the frontal bone. It enters into the formation of the roofs of the orbital and nasal cavities. 

Sometimes a third part is included as the nasal part of the frontal bone, and sometimes this is included with the squamous part. 

The nasal part is between the brow ridges, and ends in a serrated nasal notch that articulates with the nasal bones inferiorly, and with the lacrimal and maxilla bones laterally.
