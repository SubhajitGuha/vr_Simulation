CIRCUMDUCTION


Circumduction is a conical movement of a body part, such as a ball and socket joint or the eye. 

Circumduction is a combination of flexion, extension, adduction and abduction. 

Circumduction can be best performed at ball and socket joints, such as the hip and shoulder, but may also be performed by other parts of the body such as fingers, hands, feet, and head.

For example, circumduction occurs when spinning the arm when performing a serve in tennis or bowling a cricket ball.
