FACIAL CANAL

The facial canal (Canalis nervi facialis), also known as the Fallopian canal, first described by Gabriele Falloppio, is a Z-shaped canal running through the temporal bone from the internal acoustic meatus to the stylomastoid foramen. 

In humans it is approximately 3 centimeters long, which makes it the longest human osseous canal of a nerve.

It is located within the middle ear region, according to its shape it is divided into three main segments: the labyrinthine, the tympanic, and the mastoidal segment.

It contains Cranial Nerve VII, also known as the facial nerve. 

    PROMINENCE
    
The prominence of the facial canal (or prominence of the aqueduct of Fallopius) indicates the position of the bony facial canal in which the facial nerve is contained; this canal traverses the medial wall of the tympanic cavity above the oval window, and behind this it curves nearly vertically downward along the posterior wall.
