SPINE OF SPHENOID BONE


The great wings, or alae-sphenoids, are two strong processes of bone, which arise from the sides of the body, and are curved upward, lateralward, and backward; the posterior part of each projects as a triangular process which fits into the angle between the squama and the petrous portion of the temporal bone and presents at its apex a downwardly directed process, the spina angularis (sphenoidal spine).  

It serves as the origin for the sphenomandibular ligament.
