SINUS OF THE FRONTAL BONE

The frontal sinuses are one of the four pairs of paranasal sinuses that are situated behind the brow ridges. 

Sinuses are mucosa-lined airspaces within the bones of the face and skull. 

Each opens into the anterior part of the corresponding middle nasal meatus of the nose through the frontonasal duct which traverses the anterior part of the labyrinth of the ethmoid. 

These structures then open into the semilunar hiatus in the middle meatus.
