CLIVUS

The clivus (Latin for "slope") is a bony part of the cranium at the skull base, a shallow depression behind the dorsum sell√¶ that slopes obliquely backward. 

It forms a gradual sloping process at the anterior most portion of the basilar occipital bone at its junction with the sphenoid bone. 

On axial planes, it sits just posterior to the sphenoid sinuses. Just lateral to the clivus bilaterally is the foramen lacerum (the internal carotid artery reaches the middle cranial fossa above the foramen lacerum), proximal to its anastomosis with the Circle of Willis. Posterior to the clivus is the basilar artery.

The pons sits on the clivus.

Clivus is also used as an abbreviated term for the clivus ocularis which is the sloping inner wall of the retina as it dips into the foveola in the macula of the eye. 

For this reason, and to disambiguate, the clivus is sometimes referred to as the Blumenbach clivus.
