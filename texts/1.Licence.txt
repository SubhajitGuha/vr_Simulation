The contribution of 'Z-anatomy' has been to
-repair the meshes (they should all be 'watertight')
-reduce the weight of the files (cleaning; cloning symmetrical structures)
-rename and organize the anatomical structures according to the 'Terminologia Anatomica-2d edition(2019)'
-integrate the structures of the 1st model into the second, when they were missing 
-Add materials
-Add the muscular insertions (of the appendicular skeleton,so far)
-Create a shortcut that gives access to collection through a double Left-clic
