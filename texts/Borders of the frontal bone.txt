BORDERS OF FRONTAL BONE

The border of the squamous part is thick, strongly serrated, bevelled at the expense of the inner table above, where it rests upon the parietal bones, and at the expense of the outer table on either side, where it receives the lateral pressure of those bones; this border is continued below into a triangular, rough surface, which articulates with the great wing of the sphenoid.

The posterior borders of the orbital plates are thin and serrated, and articulate with the small wings of the sphenoid.
