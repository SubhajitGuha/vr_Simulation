MEDIAL/POSTERO-MEDIAL BORDER OF FIBULA


The postero-medial border, sometimes called the oblique line, begins above at the medial side of the head, and ends by becoming continuous with the interosseous crest at the lower fourth of the bone. 

It is well-marked and prominent at the upper and middle parts of the bone. 

It gives attachment to an aponeurosis which separates the tibialis posterior from the soleus and flexor hallucis longus.
