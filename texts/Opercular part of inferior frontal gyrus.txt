OPERCULAR PART OF INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS


The inferior frontal gyrus is highly convoluted and has three cytoarchitecturally diverse regions.

The three subdivisions are an opercular part, a triangular part, and an orbital part. 

These divisions are marked by two rami arising from the lateral sulcus.

The ascending ramus separates the opercular and triangular parts.

The anterior (horizontal) ramus separates the triangular and orbital parts.

Opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), (cortex posterior to the ascending ramus of the lateral sulcus), is the part of frontal lobe that overlies the insular cortex and may be associated with recognizing a tone of voice in spoken native languages.

This expands on previous work indicating that comprehension of inflectional morpheme processing is associated with the inferior frontal gyrus.

Cytoarchitecturally the opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus is known as Brodmann area 44 (BA44).
