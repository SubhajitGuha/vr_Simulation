ENDO-ABDOMINAL FASCIA (to be verified)


The endoabdominal fascia refers to all the fasciae covering the inner side of the abdominal cavity:

    -The transversalis fascia: 
        the outer layer that lies between the inner surface of the transverse abdominis muscle and the extraperitoneal tissue. 
    
    -The extraperitoneal tissue: 
        the layer of connective tissue between the transversalis fascia and parietal peritoneum.
    
    -The parietal peritoneum (or fascia): 
        the layer covers the abdomen and surrounds the organs.
         
    -The visceral peritoneum (or layer): 
        the inner layer that lines the organs and is known as the visceral peritoneum in the abdomen, pleura around the lungs and pericardium around the heart.
